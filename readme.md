Introduction to Front-End Development
This repository contains the final project I completed while taking the "Introduction to Front-End Development" course as part of the Meta Professional Front End Development Certificate. This project provides a basic introduction to web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Description
The project is a basic website with a landing page, an about page, and a contact page. The landing page is designed to introduce the user to the website and provide a brief overview of what the website is about. The about page provides more detailed information about the website and its purpose. The contact page allows users to get in touch with the website's creator.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the website, while the CSS is used to style the website and make it visually appealing. The JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website, such as a navigation menu and a contact form.

Project Files
The project files can be found in the "src" folder. The "index.html" file is the landing page, the "about.html" file is the about page, and the "contact.html" file is the contact page. The "css" folder contains the CSS stylesheets, and the "js" folder contains the JavaScript files.

Getting Started
To view the website, simply open any of the HTML files in a web browser. The website is fully functional and can be navigated using the navigation menu. The contact form can also be used to send a message to the website's creator.

Conclusion
This project was an excellent introduction to front-end development and provided a solid foundation for further learning. I hope you find this project useful and informative, and I encourage you to continue exploring the world of web development.
